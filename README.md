# BigNumber
Implementation of numbers in C ++ using related lists. 
The size of the number depends on the architecture on which the code is run. Of course, the number of bits is greater than 64 and allows you to add, subtract, multiply and divide numbers. 
Perhaps the possibility of exponentiation, priming and checking if a given number is prime will be designed. 
Binary, hexadecimal and decimal number display available. 

Project in progress. Currently working on the printDEC function.
